//GCD O(min(x,y))

// Optimization: The maximum possible value for the GCD of two numbers x and y is
//  the smaller of the two numbers. If x is 12 and y is 8, the largest possible GCD can only be 8 or less. 
// Therefore, there is no need to check numbers greater than the smaller of the two numbers because they canâ€™t possibly be a common divisor. Using Math.min(x, y) ensures that you only iterate up to the smaller of the two numbers, making the loop more efficient.
